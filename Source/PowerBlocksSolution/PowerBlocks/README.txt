Summary
-----------------------------------------
Core namespace contains generally reusable, generic, utilities and tools that are used to simplify and facilitate the development of all other namespaces. By design the Core namespace is a stand-alone project that has no dependencies on other parts of the system. Core includes utilities and helpers such as encryption classes, configuration classes, networking classes, serialization classes etc.

Core will likely be referenced by all other projects in the solution. Any project agnostic code that can be reusble across any system is a greaet candidate to be put in the Core.
